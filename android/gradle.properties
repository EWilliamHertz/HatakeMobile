This file is used to configure Gradle building process.
It's a good place to store sensitive data like keystore passwords.

The following property is VERY IMPORTANT for React Native builds.
It allows Gradle to use more memory and prevents out-of-memory errors.
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m

This tells Gradle to use the new Android R8 code shrinker.
android.useAndroidX=true

This enables Jetifier to automatically convert third-party libraries
to use AndroidX, which is required for modern React Native.
android.enableJetifier=true

This is the crucial fix.
It directly injects the Android SDK path into the Gradle build,
making it impossible for any library to miss it.
sdk.dir=/usr/lib/android-sdk
